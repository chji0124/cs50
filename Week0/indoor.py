#WRITING IN ALL CAPS IS LIKE YELLING.

#Best to use your “indoor voice” sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.

# In a file called indoor.py, 
# implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input 
# and then outputs that same input in lowercase. 
# Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. 

caps = input("")
lowercase = caps.lower()
print(lowercase)
